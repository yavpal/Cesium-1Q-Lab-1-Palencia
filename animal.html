             <p> Rabbits are ground dwellers that live in environments ranging from desert to tropical forest and wetland. 
                Their natural geographic range in the Western Hemisphere encompasses the middle latitudes. In the Eastern Hemisphere rabbits are found in Europe, portions of Central and Southern Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Sumatra, and Japan. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) has been introduced to many locations around the world, and all breeds of domestic rabbit originate from the European. Nearly half of the worldâ€™s rabbit species are in danger of extinction; many are among the most vulnerable of all mammals.</p>
